## Project Description
<p align="justify">
The project for this course is to build a smart text editor/processor that incorporates “intelligent” behaviors of modern-day text interfaces, including autocomplete, flagging misspelled words, and spelling autocorrect.  In each module, you’ll add more functionality to the editor through the project associated with that module.
